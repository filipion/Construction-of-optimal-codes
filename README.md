## (to be completed) GSoC 2018 project presentation
The following is an overview of my collaboration with GSoC and Sagemath on the databases/bounds of codes project.

# Summary
The parameter known as Hamming weight or minimum distance of a linear code is important from both a theoretical and an applied standpoint. Coding theorists are interested in the search for codes with large Hamming weights under the constraint of fixing other code parameters, usually length and dimension.
